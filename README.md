# BusyBASIC
like assembly but i did a silly and called it BusyBasic instead of BusyAssembly although that doesn't really roll of the tongue as much as BusyBasic oh well.
so like assembly but it's single bit manipulation so its busy beavers kind of
# pls no steal
i will be sad... also i liscenced so your legally not can do that unless credit is give to me
# how does it work?
so first you say how big you want your data to be,, (i say 8 is good for small programs)<br>
then you typee your code!! (maybe one day i will add so it can read lines with import sys and file = argv)<br>
## how does a la making code workee?
each instruction is 5 bits,,,, the first 3 are the instruction and the last 2 are the arguments!!!
so for example 001 changes the bit, but the arguments determine how it does that!
## then what happens?
then you will see the code happening happen,,, so wepic!!
