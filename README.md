# BusyBASIC
like basic but you use the bit so its busy beaver kind of
# pls no steal
i will be sad... also i liscenced so your legally not can do that unless credit is give to me
# how does it work?
so first you say how big you want your data to be,, (i say 8 is good for small programs)<br>
then you typee your code!! (maybe one day i will add so it can read lines with import sys and file = argv)<br>
## how does a la code workee?
each instruction is 5 bits,,,, the first 3 are the instruction and the last 2 are the arguments!!!
so for example 001 changes the bit, but the arguments determine how it does that!
## then what happens?
then you will see the code happening happen,,, so wepic!!
